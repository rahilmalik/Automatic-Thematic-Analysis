# Automating Thematic-Analysis
I automate the process of thematic analysis, Using BERT for Text classification and BERTopic for Topic Modelling. Then, I generated a report that showcases the information in a concise format.

## Why? 
Why did I try to automate the process of manual thematic analysis?

This project demonstrates how combining these language models' help can enhance the efficiency of qualitative analysis by reducing the manual labour required, while still providing insightful results that align with traditional analysis methods.


Note: The data this project works on was National Student Survey data specific to Brunel University, the data is confidential and access is provided to only people at Brunel.


## Topic Modelling using BERTopic 

The objective is to develop and implement a topic modeling using BERTopic to automatically identify and categorize themes within large textual datasets, demonstrating its application for extracting insights from survey responses.

## Text Classification using BERT 

The goal here is to create a text classification model using BERT to accurately predict categories from raw text data, with an emphasis on improving accuracy and reducing manual labour in text annotation tasks. 

## Generating the Report

The task is to use the predicted data from Text Classification and themes from topic Modelling then generate a report which uses data visualization and showcases the useful information extracted from the new data generated.
